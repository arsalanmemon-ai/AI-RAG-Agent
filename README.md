AI RAG Agent â€” n8n Workflow (Supabase + Gemini)

I have created an AI Assistant workflow in n8n that uses Google Gemini, Supabase Vector Store, and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).
This agent can store knowledge, recall conversations, and answer questions based on documents.

Workflow Includes:

Google Gemini (Chat + Embeddings)
Supabase Vector Store
Simple Memory for chat history
Document Embedding & Search
Auto-response via Chat Trigger
